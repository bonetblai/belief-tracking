Vars:

bool hit(x,y)    : whether this cell has been hit by torpedo or not
bool horiz(x,y)  : whether the ship in this cell is placed horizontally or not
int  size(x,y)   : the size of the ship that this cell has
int  anchor(x,y) : the anchor point of this cell in the ship
int  nhits(x,y)  : number of hits that the ship in this cell has

size(x,y) == 0 means no ship at cell

Constraints:

  if size(x,y) == 0, then horiz(x,y) == false
                          anchor(x,y) == 0
                          nhits(x,y) == 0

  if size(x,y) == 1, then horiz(x,y) == false

  anchor(x,y) >= 0 && anchor(x,y) < size(x,y) (unless size(x,y) == 0)

  nhits(x,y >= 0 && mhits(x,y) <= size(x,y)

Obs:

boolean WATER
boolean HIT
boolean SUNK__<size>__<anchor>__<horiz>
