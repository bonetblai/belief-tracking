The code in here is based on the Wumpus simulator created by
James Biagioni, called wumpuslite (ver 0.21 (alpha)).

The original code had been slightly modified for being able
to plug our AI agent and to measure some statistics along the
execution across several trials.  The original code can be
found at this project website in the file wumpuslite021a.zip.
